# comments in e-nglish
To add comments to a program in e-nglish, type a semicolon, and everything after it on the same line will be part of the comment:

```
#include console ; Printy print print.

print "Hello, world!" ; Hi!
```

You can end a comment with another semicolon and cannot write comments inside of strings:

```
#include ; This uses the console. ; console

print "This has a semicolon in it; it's valid syntax!"
```

If you want a semicolons in comments, use Greek question marks! (Í¾)
