# Engle
###### A programming language for the normies.
---
## Pronunciation
It is pronounced very similarly to “angle.”

## Data Types
I have added a temporary list of default types in
this file so I can't just forget to add one.

### Primitives
- `boolean` - stores either `true` or `false`
- `byte` / `unsigned byte` - an unsigned 8-bit integer
- `float` - a 32-bit floating-point number
- `double` - a 64-bit floating-point number
- `signed byte` - a signed 8-bit integer
- `int` / `signed int` - a signed 32-bit integer
- `unsigned int` - an unsigned 32-bit integer
- `long int` / `signed long int` - a signed 64-bit integer
- `unsigned long int` - an unsigned 64-bit integer
- `short int` / `signed short int` - a signed 16-bit integer
- `unsigned short int` - an unsigned 16-bit integer
- `char` - a signed 8-bit ASCII code
- `character` - a 32-bit Unicode codepoint

### Data Structures
- `pointer` - stores a reference to another variable of a specific type
- `string` - stores a sequence of values, which normally represent text
- `array` - stores multiple values of a specific type in an imaginary
one-or-more-dimensional grid
- `matrix` - essentially the same basic idea as an array,
but it can cover any range of indexes (normally starting at 1) and can
be rotated in increments of 90 degrees
- `tuple` - similar to an array, but with multiple types
- `enum` - similar to a tuple, but with names instead of indexes
